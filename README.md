# cats_api
For current task I decided to use PostmanAgent for mentioned collections API. 
By using the Postman API I tested goals API from our class repository and cats API which have been selected by me.
One of the main reasons for choosing this technology was the clean interface and simplicity in creating the requests. 
As well as the easy export to json format files
